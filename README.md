## Einsum puzzles

Solve puzzles, learn einsum.

It's recommended to open in [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pixqc/einsum-puzzles/blob/master/main.ipynb). Cloning and running locally also works, just make sure you have numpy installed.

Inspired by [srush/Tensor-Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Tensor-Puzzles). Please DM me on [X](https://x.com/pixqc) or [Discord](https://discord.com/users/pixqc) if you have any criticisms/suggestions ^_^
